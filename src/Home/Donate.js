        <h1>A Message from Internet Archive Founder, Brewster Kahle</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>Dear Internet Archive Community,</p>

        <p>
          Right now more than ever before, we need your help. 2020 brought
          unique challenges and unprecedented demand for our services. In the
          middle of a global pandemic, natural disasters, and political turmoil,
          we're all turning to our screens for information—today is the
          Internet's day.
        </p>

        <p>
          With our staff working remotely and our community relying on us like
          never before, we’re providing resources to digital learners,
          entertaining quarantined citizens everywhere, and archiving history as
          it unfolds. As physical libraries remain closed and the world adjusts
          to a new normal, we’re offering millions of texts, audio files,
          webpages, images, and other resources for users around the world.
          Right now:
        </p>

        <p>
          The Internet Archive has always kept our collections completely free
          for everyone, everywhere. But we don’t charge for access, sell user
          data, or run ads. Instead, we rely on the generosity of individuals
          like you to pay for servers, staff, and preservation projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          A little goes a long way. For $20, we can acquire, digitize, and
          preserve a book forever. If everyone who uses the archive contributed
          just $5, we could continue offering these services for free and
          ad-free for years to come. If you find our site useful, please chip
          in! Your support will help us build the web we deserve. Together we
          can make it through these turbulent times and continue advancing
          Universal Access to All Knowledge.
        </p>

        <p>Thank you for joining me.</p>
